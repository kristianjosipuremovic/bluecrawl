Phase 1: Expand Current File Scanner

    Improve entropy calculations (whole file, sliding window).

    Add more file metadata features: timestamps anomalies, permissions, ownership.

    Optimize file crawler for speed and error handling.

Phase 2: Implement Machine Learning

    Build labeled dataset from your enhanced features.

    Train simple classifiers (logistic regression, random forest) to predict suspiciousness.

    Integrate ML model into the scanner to replace or complement heuristic scoring.

Phase 3: Add Snapshot System Information Scans

    Process & Service Scan: list running processes/services, calculate entropy of loaded modules, flag suspicious paths.

    Network Scan: list open connections, suspicious IPs/ports.

    User Accounts & Privileges: list users with admin rights, recent additions.

Phase 4: Finalize & Document

    Clean, modularize code.

    Add CLI interface with options and help messages.

    Write comprehensive README: usage, features, examples.

    Add tests and error handling.

    Package project (e.g., via setup.py) for easy installation.
